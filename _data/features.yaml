    body:  |
      <p>
      PsySH can be used as an interactive debugger, much like JavaScript's <code>debugger</code> statement, saving you
      from endless <code>var_dump()</code> and <code>die()</code> iterations. Just drop this line in where you'd like to
      have a breakpoint:
      </p>
      <p><code>eval(\Psy\sh());</code></p>

  - title: "Auto<code>[tab][tab]</code>Complete"

    body:  |
      <p>
      PsySH has tab completion for variable names, functions, classes, methods, properties, and even files!
      Just start typing, then hit <code>[tab]</code>. But you probably already guessed that.
      </p>
      <p>
      <small>(Tab completion requires Readline- or Libedit-enabled PHP. But you really should have that anyway)</small>

      all variables, constants, classes, interfaces, traits, functions, methods and properties.
      </p>
      <p><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; help list</code></p>
